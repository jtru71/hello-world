CTID Homework #1

My name is Jimmy Truong. I am a Vietnamese male at the age of 35 learning how to code! I am currently married to my wonderful wife of 13 years. We have two dogs named Fred and George. I'm not sure where I want to end up with my coding adventure, but I hope to have that narrowed down in the near future.
